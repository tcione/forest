# forest

The CLI tool endorsed by your local Forest Preservation Clubâ„¢ for managing [(git) worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).

**:warning: This is still beta software. Core functionality likely won't change, but the feature set is not yet complete and might require fundamental changes depending on what I discover. Please check the "roadmap" section to see what's planned for the future.**

## But really, what is this?

A CLI tool to make working with [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) easier by establishing a few conventions and abstracting away some git commands.

## Then, what are the conventions?

- Repositories are called `roots`
- Worktrees are called `trees`
- `roots` live under `{base_dir}/roots`
- `trees` live under `{base_dir}/trees`
- All trees exist under the `trees` folder, regardless of `root`
- `tree` folders are named after the following pattern: `{root}--{branch-name}`
- When creating the `tree` folder name, `root` and `branch-name` get normalized by replacing any character different from `[A-Za-z0-9\-_]` by `--`
- `forest tree create <root> <branch>` will always branch out from the latest version of `root`'s default branch. Meaning whenever `create` is invoked, `git pull origin <default-branch` is performed in the `root` directory

## Nice! How can I install this?

### Nix flake

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    forest.url = "github:tcione/forest";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, forest }: {
    # Add to your system packages
    nixosConfigurations.yourhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          environment.systemPackages = [ forest.packages.x86_64-linux.forest ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Or with Home Manager:
```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...
    forest.url = "path:/home/tortoise/Projects/src/forest";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, home-manager, darwin, ...}@inputs:
  let
    system = "x86_64-linux";
  in {
    # ...
    nixosConfigurations.{user} = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        {
          nixpkgs.overlays = [
            (
              final: prev: {
               forest = inputs.forest.packages.${system}.default;
             }
            )
          ];
        }
        # ...
        home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager {
          # ...
          home-manager.users.{user}.imports = [
            # ...
            inputs.forest.homeManagerModules.${system}.default
            ./home.nix
          ];
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

```nix
# in home.nix
programs.forest = {
  enable = true;
  settings = {
    general = {
      baseDir = "${config.home.homeDirectory}/Projects";
      copy = [".env" ".envrc"];
      exec = [];
    };
  };
};
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install tcione/tap/forest
```

### Other

1. Download the latest binary for your system under [releases](https://github.com/tcione/forest/releases)
2. Place somewhere visible in your `PATH`

## Now how can I use it?

1. Clone a repo: `forest roots clone <repo address>`
2. Create a tree: `forest trees create <root/repo-name> <branch-name>`
3. Use git normally inside `tree` and `root` (just avoid leaving the default branch in `root`)

## What does future look like? (roadmap)
0.10.1 - Current version

- [x] Proper documentation
- [x] Test homebrew setup
- [ ] 0.11.0: "fogo" bash setup (command that takes user to tree or root)
- [ ] 0.12.0: Fuzzy selection in "path", "exec" and "create"
- [ ] 0.13.0: CLI completions
- [ ] 0.14.0: Allow user to create local repos via `forest roots`
- [ ] 0.15.0: Allow for local repo configs using `forest.toml` at the `root`'s folder
- [ ] 0.15.1: Prepare repo for 1.0.0 by tidying up codebase, ensure consistency and double-checking standards. Check if there's anything else to take care before 1.0.0
...
- [ ] 1.0.0: "Formal" release of 1.0.0, no features here

## Configuration

If you have no configuration set, one is created for you when using the tool for the first time.

The configuration file is stored in one of the following places:
- **Linux**: `~/.config/forest/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/forest/config.toml`

And it looks like this:
```config.toml
[general]
# Dir where /roots and /trees will be stored
base_dir = "~/Projects"

# Files to be copied from root to tree on creation
copy = ["./.envrc", ".env"]

# CLI commands to be called when creating a tree
exec = []

[roots.{repo-name}]
copy = [".envrc", ".env", "some-other-file"]
exec = [
    "npm install"
]
```
